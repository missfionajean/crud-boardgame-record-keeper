Weighted vs unweighted leaderboards - factors in how much that person is actually here and adjusts standings accordingly, so Dan/Fiona don't dominate

Dynamic leaderboards - populate when loading, not stored elsewhere; orders player profiles based on a point value that is given based on how many people they beat in any given game, not the place they finished (gives more weight to games with more people) 

Filters - can be generated based on different criteria, such as all-time, specific games or genres, etc.

Learning Profiles - User input is minimal, instead their profile will adjust itself based on their performance and play records (strengths, favorite genre, etc)

Level Up System - This is fun, but can get dicey; maybe base it off number of games played rather than specific performance (passive incentive)

Avatars - Player should pick a color for their avatar, which will change shape as they level-up (i.e. pawn -> bishop -> knight -> rook -> queen -> king or the like [ASK DAN HIS OPINION])

Still need a solution for co-op games...
